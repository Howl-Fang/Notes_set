This is the note set generated during tinkering computers.

The idea came from a friend in university, who does records on many things and thoughts. 
I found this quite useful when looking back, no matter finding technical details that I once met, or just to taste the feeling of achievement.

I hope the spirit could last long. Once I kept a diary book but it's getting unavailable since my college life, due to regional reasons...

This repo was made to be public, but its owner might just changes the mind. However English is not my mother tongue,  I will use Chinese in most conditions.
